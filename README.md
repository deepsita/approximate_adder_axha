This project is an implementation of approximate adder for error tolerant multimedia applications.

The approximate single bit adder is built using which multi bit adder is built basing on the approximation factor. The delay chain is completely eliminated for the approximate part and is reduced by length k for accurate half of the n-bit approximate adder.
